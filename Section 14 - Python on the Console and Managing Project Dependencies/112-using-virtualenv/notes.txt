create virtual environment with virtualenv venv python=python3.7 (or any other version of python)

change source to the virtual environment with:
source venv/bin/activate

this gives you a fresh copy of a python environment without anything added
install all packages as required

pip freeze gives you all packages / libraries currently installed

pip freeze > requirements.txt saves the library names and versions in a file called requirements.txt

install all requirements automatically with pip install -r requirements.txt (great for sharing)

use "deactivate" to come out of the virtual environment

remove virtual environment by using rm -rf venv
