Install pip environment by using pipenv

If requirements file exists (requirements.txt), use pipenv install to set up a new pip virtual environment

Once you create the virtual environment with pipenv install, two files are created Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
Pipfile is a list of all libraries installed. Pipfile.lock is a lock file with security hashes

Once you create the virtual environment, you should delete the requirements.txt file
This is because you can now share the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files to share dependencies
However, that user will have to run pipenv install to install packages

You can modify the Pipenv file but must run pipenv install to update the lock file
